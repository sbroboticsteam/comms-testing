============================================================================
This is an example of how to test communication between modules.

In this directory, there are two example modules: Sender and Receiver.

The config file describing the connection between them is in example.json
in the configs directory.

The script that starts up these modules is example.py in the starters
directory.

To run this example test, cd to the starters directory and run
$ python example.py


============================================================================
DIRECTIONS TO TEST YOUR OWN MODULES:

1. Create a json config file for the modules you want to test.
	
	You can use the configurator app to generate the json. 
	Type the following command in terminal to open the app:
	$ commsconf
	
	*just remember that the name of each host(=module) needs to
	match the one in your code, and the id of each topic is going
	to be the string you send to the send/recv/etc. methods*

2. Make a copy of example.py (in the starters directory), and replace
   the imports and constants with those for your own modules.
